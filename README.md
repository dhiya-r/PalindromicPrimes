# Palindrome Prime Finder

## Description
The `palindromeprime.py` is a Python program that finds all palindromic primes between two integers supplied as input (start and end points are excluded). 

A **palindrome number** is a number that reads the same from the front and the back. Examples are: 212, 44, 9009, 4567654. To calculate whether a number is a palindrome or not, you can first reverse the number (using the % operator and a loop, or a String) and then check for equality.

A **prime number** is one that is only divisible by 1 and itself. Examples are: 3, 11, 313. Some examples of palindromic primes are: 11, 191, 313.

## How to Run
To run the program, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `palindromeprime.py`, and type `python palindromeprime.py`.
Alternately, if you have VS Code install python. Then select an interpreter by clicking Control+Shift+P and trying Python: Select Interpreter and choose one. Navigate to the directory containing `palindromeprime.py` and run it.
